\subsection{PhotoPrism}

I used the app \gls{PP} to de-duplicate my images. The last 15 years a lot of
duplicates blowed up the collection. Let's start with the first step, the
installation of the plugin.

The next step has been the creation of the following shared folders:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \tsTextMonospace{photoprism} -- The location for the image database.
    \item \tsTextMonospace{photoprism_import} -- The share used for image import.
    \item \tsTextMonospace{photos}  -- The final location of the photos in an organized way.
\end{itemize}

The setup is easy, just set the shares -- that's all folks. Okay -- I remember
some images I made with a digital SLR camera. They are large as I remember, so
I've increased the filesize limit to 5 GB.
