\subsection{Autoshutdown}

To save some energy we want the system to shutdown when not used and to wake up
when used. So we want to use the autoshutdown plugin and the \gls{WOL} feature.
\tsFontBold{NOTE:} Don't forget to enable \gls{WOL} in the BIOS. For my system
there have been two settings, one setting on the adapter itself and one setting
in the boot options.

As first step we have to enable the \gls{WOL} on the network card. You can find
the checkbox as last option ot the \tsFontCode{Advanced settings} section.

Then we have to configure/setup the autoshutdown plugin. First step is to
enable the autoshutdown. Second step is to force an uptime between 23:30 and
02:00 to ensure backup is done. The rest is left with default settings and
might be updated at a later point.
