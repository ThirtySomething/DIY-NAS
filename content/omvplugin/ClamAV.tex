\subsection{ClamAV}\label{subsec:ClamAV}

To protect the data I want to use an antivirus program. As open source solution
there is \gls{CAV} available -- and also as plugin for \gls{OMV}.

In the setup we use the previously defined quarantine folder.

I enabled a scan on access for specific folders.

Also I've enabled a scheduled scan for these folders, too.

Maybe somebody will claim that all scheduled scans run on the same time.\linebreak
Yes -- this was setup to check the power of the CPU. The system load increases
to a load of about 3 -- that's fantastic from my point of view! This means that
there are more than enough reserves. When I'm spreading the schedule I can
lower the load.
