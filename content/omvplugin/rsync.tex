\subsection{rsync}

On Linux it's usual to use \gls{rsy} to synchronize data between different
locations. \gls{omv} offers a \gls{rsy} service -- it's not a plugin in the
usual meaning. There are many different scenarios possible -- I'll describe
two of them. The first one is the sync in the direction of the \gls{nes} to
the \gls{nos}, also known as rsync push:

\tsImageO{./images/OMV-rsync-01.png}{rsync push 1}{\custCopyright{}}{width=\textwidth}

\tsImageO{./images/OMV-rsync-02.png}{rsync push 2}{\custCopyright{}}{width=\textwidth}

The second one is the sync in the direction of the \gls{nos} to
the \gls{nes}, also known as rsync pull:

\tsImageO{./images/OMV-rsync-03.png}{rsync pull 1}{\custCopyright{}}{width=\textwidth}

\tsImageO{./images/OMV-rsync-04.png}{rsync pull 2}{\custCopyright{}}{width=\textwidth}

I've both methods to backup/restore my data using the \gls{nos} while setting
up the \gls{nes}.
