\section{Initial situation}

In 2010 I bought my first \gls{NAS}. It was a \gls{Synology}
\href{https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/11-year/DS411slim/ger/Synology_DS411slim_Data_Sheet_ger.pdf}{DS411slim}.
The device is running up to now. For a few years now, it is only supplied with
security updates. That is quite remarkable for the fact that it has already 12
years on the hump.
\bigbreak

Now I've run out of space - I have 4*2TB running there in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID}{RAID 10},
which results in about 3.7TB. In addition, the performance is, well, not quite up
to date.
