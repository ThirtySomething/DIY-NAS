\section{Docker}

By using \gls{Docker} I want to enhance the \gls{NAS} with features which are not
available out-of-the-box. Especially with services my previous \gls{NAS} offers
and which are not native available for \gls{OMV}.

\subsection{Docker installation}

The default location of \gls{Docker} is \tsFontCode{/var/lib/docker} on the
system disk. Allthough the system disk is a fast SSD, I want to install
\gls{Docker} on the slower RAID storage. So I have to change the path of
\gls{Docker} storage.

In case \gls{Docker} is already installed, see \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenMediaVault/comments/fl40gf/moving_docker_storage/}{here}
how to move the \gls{Docker} storage to another location.

\subsection{Portainer}

To have more comfort in dealing with \gls{Docker} we install also \gls{Portainer}
from the \gls{OMVE}.

After installation \gls{Portainer} is up and running.
