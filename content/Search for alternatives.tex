\section{Search for alternatives}

\subsection{Use a mini PC in front of the NAS}

Realizing this situation I was searching for alternatives. The first idea was
to use an existing \href{https://www.zotac.com/at/product/mini_pcs/id41-plus}{mini PC}
in front of the \gls{nas}. This failed for some reasons.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using the \gls{nas} directly for \gls{doc} volumes only possible using
          \linebreak
          \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI}{iSCSI} -- everything else
          I was not successful.
    \item The CPU of the mini PC does not support \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_virtualization}{Intel VT}
          for virtualization in case of \href{https://www.proxmox.com/}{Proxmox} for
          example.
    \item The network itself as bottleneck for \gls{doc} containers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware alternatives}

Then I decided to by a new \gls{nas} system. But which kind of \gls{nas} will
it be? I've spent a long time to search the internet for possible soultions.
I didn't know about the possibility to pimp a \href{https://www.terra-master.com}{TerraMaster \gls{nas}}
with a different \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Fh8XgREJ0}{OS}. This
is also possible for \href{https://www.westerndigital.com}{Western Digital \gls{nas}}
as described \href{https://community.wd.com/t/firmware-freenas-on-pr4100-updated/218730/11}{here}
and \href{https://forum.openmediavault.org/index.php?thread/37009-can-i-install-omv-on-a-wd-nas/}{here}.
Also the variant with a mini PC and separated storage case was interesting. The
idea is to get the most out of money, so the ranking here is done by
price/performance ratio and the DIY \gls{nas} wins the comparison.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item DIY \gls{nas} system on PC base
    \item DIY \gls{nas} system with separated storage case and mini PC
    \item Commercial \gls{nas} system
    \item Commercial \gls{nas} with custom OS
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The planned hardware}

When comparing the different hardware solutions, I also made a comparison
between an Intel and an AMD based \gls{nas}. The AMD variant won the price/power
chapter, so I decided to buy:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.gskill.com/product/165/184/1536110922/F4-3200C16D-32GVK}{32GB G.Skill RipJaws V black DDR4-3200 DIMM Dual Kit}
    \item \href{https://www.samsung.com/de/memory-storage/nvme-ssd/970-evo-nvme-m-2-ssd-250gb-mz-v7e250bw/}{250GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus M.2 2280}
    \item \href{https://www.bequiet.com/de/powersupply/1539}{400 Watt be quiet! Pure Power 11 CM Modular 80+ Gold}
    \item \href{https://www.fractal-design.com/de/products/cases/node/node-304/black/}{Black Fractal Design Node 304 cube without power supply}
    \item \href{https://www.westerndigital.com/de-de/products/internal-drives/wd-red-plus-sata-3-5-hdd#WD40EFZX}{4x 4000GB WD Red Plus WD40EFZX 128MB 3.5"}
    \item \href{https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/Fatal1ty%20B450%20Gaming-ITXac/index.de.asp}{ASRock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/AC AMD B450}
    \item \href{https://www.amd.com/de/products/apu/amd-athlon-3000g}{AMD Athlon 3000G with Radeon Vega Graphics 3.5GHz}
    \item \href{https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9a-am4}{Noctua NH-L9a-AM4 topblow cooler}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The bought hardware}

\begin{figure}[H]

        \tsTextQuoteG{Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans.}
    \end{Huge}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{A quote from John Lennon}
\end{figure}

This means that the availability of chips and other events affect the market
and make it difficult to realize these plans. For example, motherboards in
mini-ITX format with AM4 socket have been really hard to get in the first half
of 2022. That's why I revised my decision on the components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.gskill.com/product/165/184/1536110922/F4-3200C16D-32GVK}{32GB G.Skill RipJaws V black DDR4-3200 DIMM Dual Kit}
    \item \href{https://www.samsung.com/de/memory-storage/nvme-ssd/970-evo-nvme-m-2-ssd-250gb-mz-v7e250bw/}{250GB Samsung 970 Evo Plus M.2 2280}
    \item \href{https://www.bequiet.com/de/powersupply/1539}{400 Watt be quiet! Pure Power 11 CM Modular 80+ Gold}
    \item \href{https://www.fractal-design.com/de/products/cases/node/node-304/black/}{Black Fractal Design Node 304 cube without power supply}
    \item \href{https://www.westerndigital.com/de-de/products/internal-drives/wd-red-plus-sata-3-5-hdd#WD40EFZX}{4x 4000GB WD Red Plus WD40EFZX 128MB 3.5"}
    \item \href{https://www.asrock.com/MB/Intel/H610M-ITXac/index.de.asp}{ASRock H610M-ITX/AC mITX Intel H610 DDR4 S1700}
    \item \href{https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/134584/intel-core-i312100-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz.html}{Intel Core I3-12100 tray}
    \item \href{https://noctua.at/en/nh-l9i-17xx}{Noctua NH-L9i-17xx topblow cooler}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The difference}

The difference is that the CPU is a latest generation
\href{https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/134584/intel-core-i312100-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-30-ghz/specifications.html?wapkw=12100}{Intel I3}
processor. The corresponding
\href{https://www.asrock.com/MB/Intel/H610M-ITXac/index.de.asp}{motherboard}
is also brand new. Both were only launched in Q1/2022.

\subsection{The consequences}

The fresh introduction to the market has some consequences: \gls{omv} 5 does
not support the network chip of the motherboard. So I decided to install the
\gls{omv} 6 beta on my DIY \gls{nas}. I also tried
\href{https://www.truenas.com/}{TrueNAS} -- it looks much more professional
than \gls{omv}, but it is also a bit more complicated to understand and
configure. It also doesn't have native support for \gls{doc}.
