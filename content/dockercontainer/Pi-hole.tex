\subsection{Pi-hole}\label{subsec:Pi-hole}

I'm already using \gls{PH} on a old \href{https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/}{Raspberry Pi 2B}
and I'm very pleased with that software. Because of it's nature working as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System#DNS_resolvers}{DNS resolver}
I won't move this to the NAS. The reason is quite simple -- this will influence
the \nameref{subsec:Autoshutdown} plugin and/or will make it obsolete. This is
not what I want to achieve.
