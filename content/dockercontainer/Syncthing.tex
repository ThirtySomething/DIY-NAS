\subsection{Syncthing}

\gls{ST} is a file synchronization service. I use this to backup automatically
data from my smartphone to the PC and then from the PC to the NAS. The setup
is easy regarding the \href{https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/README-Docker.md}{Docker README}
of the project.
\bigbreak

First of all I've created a \gls{Docker} volume. In the next step I've setup
the container regarding the ports and map the created volume to \tsFontCode{/var/syncthing}.
An important step is to set the environment variables \tsFontCode{PUID} and
\tsFontCode{GUID}. Then the container will run \tsFontCode{unless stopped}.
\bigbreak

Setting up the synchronized folders is as usual with \gls{ST}. The result
may look like this one.
