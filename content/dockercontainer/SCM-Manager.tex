\subsection{SCM-Manager}

\gls{scm} provides a comfortable user interface for \gls{git},
\href{https://www.mercurial-scm.org}{Mercurial} and \gls{svn}. Up to now I use
\gls{svn} for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control}{version control}.
Some of my repositories are private and I will never publish them to a public
hoster like \href{https://github.com}{GitHub} allthough they offer private
repositories. All my other repositories are hosted on my \gls{nas} -- the plan
is to move them to \gls{git} if possible -- just to have them on a more modern
version control system.
\bigbreak

\custDoCoYaml{scm}{SCM-Manager}

The startup of the container should work without any problems. For the setup
of \gls{scm} see the \href{https://scm-manager.org/docs/latest/en/}{documentation}.

To setup a backup of the repositories I'm using a self written Python script.
\bigbreak

The job is then setup in \gls{omv} scheduled tasks accessing the script.

\tsTextBold{NOTE:} The script needs some configuration settings. For more
details have a look \href{https://github.com/ThirtySomething/SCM-Backup}{here}.
