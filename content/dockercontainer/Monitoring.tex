\subsection{Monitoring}

Monitoring is from my point of view one of the most important parts of a
\gls{doc} infrastructure. Otherwise you won't see which container will use
which resource. So I'm using an extra stack -- thanks to \gls{stp} a ready-to-use
stack exists. The only change I made is to use an own yaml-file for monitoring.
The changes are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a path (of the checkout) as prefix instead of the \tsTextQuoteG{.}
    \item Using version 3.8 of docker-compose syntax
    \item Using latest version of the containers
    \item Using a named volume for alertmanager
\end{itemize}
