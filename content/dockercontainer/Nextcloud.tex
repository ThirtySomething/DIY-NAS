\subsection{Nextcloud}

\custDoCoYaml{ncl}{Nextcloud}

After the first startup a little bit patient is required. This is caused by
the database installation (schema, tables, \ldots). Additional I logged in to
the console of the \gls{nas} and extended the \gls{ncl} settings:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \scriptsize
    \centering
    \begin{BVerbatim}
cd /srv/<omv-raid>/docker/volumes/nextcloud_nextcloud-config/_data
vi config.php
# Add trusted domains
'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
        0 => '<IP of NAS>',
    ),
    \end{BVerbatim}
    \tsCaptionLabelFigure{Extended Nextcloud config}
\end{figure}

This is required for the logon to the user interface.
